## End to End Machine Learning Project ##

In this session, Iâ€™ll walk you through with the complete cycle of a Machine Learning project.we are going to use the 1990 California Census dataset to study and try to understand how the different attributes can make the house prices get higher or lower.

### much of the work is in the ###
Data preparation step

Deploying

Building monitoring tools

Setting up human evaluation pipelines 

Automating regular model training

### It is important to understand how your data
was computed.
